Overview of the Project

TASK 1

Project: To design basic digital logic circuits like adders nd multiplexers 


Designing an Adder
Specification: Create a 4-bit adder circuit that adds two 4-bit binary numbers.
Steps:
Define truth table for addition (16 rows).
Derive Boolean equations for each output bit (sum and carry).
Implement using appropriate logic gates (AND, OR, XOR).
Draw circuit diagram showing connections.
Simulate and verify functionality.

Designing a Multiplexer
Specification: Create a 4:1 multiplexer that selects one of four inputs based on a 2-bit control signal.
Steps:
Define truth table for selection based on control input.
Derive Boolean equations for each output (output is connected to selected input).
Implement using AND, OR gates for logic, and multiplexer component.
Draw circuit diagram showing connections.
Simulate and verify functionality.
